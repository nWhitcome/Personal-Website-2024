A static build of nathanwhitcome.com using only HTML and CSS.
My goal with this project was to build a simple, clean website to showcase my software engineering qualifications, experience, and projects. I built one in the past that used Vue.js but decided to challenge myself to simplify it as much as possible while maintaining code quality, efficiency, and readability.

## Building / Deploying
There is no reactive framework or anything complex going on here, so it's as simple as downloading the files and opening index.html!
The website itself is hosted on Netlify and routed using CloudFlare.
